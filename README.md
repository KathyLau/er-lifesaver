-In our web application, we made a site where you can search for the closest emergency rooms with the shortest waiting times at your current location. While New York has the highest hospital occupancy rate in the nation, it also has an overall grade of ‘C-’ for having the 4th longest average ER waiting time, around 6.1 hours. As a result, we allow hospitals to update their waiting time data in an easy and quick way for everyone to access. We also allow registered users to send their medical information to a hospital and inform it that they’re coming before their arrival. This will help disperse the patients over a greater number of ERs, reduce overcrowding, relieve stressed and overworked doctors, and provide a faster and better experience for everyone.
